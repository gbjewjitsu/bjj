# Against De La Riva

* hold the pants, below the knee
* other hand grabs the collar
* back step a little, to rock the guy forward.
* collar arm, connect elbow to outside of your knee. This is to block knee shield
* when he frames, switch from pants to arm
* pull arm up, to flatten him
* slide knee to the mat, stay on the hip, blow his hip with your elbow
* once you pass, heel close to butt
* keep yourself on the side...do not switch to side control too quick
