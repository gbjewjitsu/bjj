# Overcoming the Complexity Problem - The 6 Principles of Sweeps from Open Guard

## 09 Feet off the Floor Principle
* Get his feet off the matt.  Any time you lift his feet, the person no longer has contact with the mat.  They loose control and fall over.


## 10 Double Direction
* **Push** / **Pull** at the same time
	* Pushing on the top part of the body (head, neck) **and** the bottom (legs, hips) in the opposite direction

## 11 Arm Trap
* Trap the arm across the center line
* Sweep towards the trapped arm

## 12 Action Reaction
* Use the reaction to complete the move
* If you pull with lapel, but the guy stops it, follow up with another move which takes advantage of the off balance.

Two types of action/reaction
* Backwards  and forwards
	* Against standing man
* Side to side
	* Against kneeling man

## 13 Wrestling Reversal
* Wrestle up
* Double leg
* Single leg
* Ankle pick


## 14 Double Trouble
* When attacking one side, 90% of the defense will come from the apposite side
	* Attack left leg, defense comes from the right leg
